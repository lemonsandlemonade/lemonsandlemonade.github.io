		<h1> Hey, it's Me! </h1>
<br>

<p> Hello and welcome to all my viewers. I am Kayla and I hope you're enjoying this blog I've created from scratch! Now I know, you must be thinking, <i>from scratch?</i> Yep! From scratch! And I wouldn't have achieved this without the Computer Science for Cybersecurity Summer program I'm taking at NYU.</p>
<p> I've learned so much in the CS4CS camp this Summer 2018! It's been an exciting and inspirational experience. I love the interest in promoting women in the computer science field. This camp has pressed me to become more involved in cyber security and bring it to my school.</p>
<p> From as far back as I can remember, I wanted to become a doctor. <i>Really.</i> From I was in kindergarten I shared my dreams of helping my family any time they needed medical attention. What I didn't notice, however, was how involved I also was in computing. I was fortunate enough to have computers in my house from a young age. I was also fortunate enough to have a mom who knows that sometimes you learn best without any help. That's why if I asked her a question, such as <i> How do I record my voice in Powerpoint?</i>, she would simply tell me to "figure it out" myself. Now when I look back, I realize the importance of fostering the passion for computer science as well as the medical field. </p>
