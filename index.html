		<h1> Hey, it's Me! </h1>
<br>

<p> Hello and welcome to all my viewers. I am Kayla and I hope you're enjoying this blog I've created from scratch! Now I know, you must be thinking, <i>from scratch?</i> Yep! From scratch! And I wouldn't have achieved this without the Computer Science for Cybersecurity Summer program I'm taking at NYU.</p>
<p> I've learned so much in the CS4CS camp this Summer 2018! It's been an exciting and inspirational experience. I love the interest in promoting women in the computer science field. This camp has pressed me to become more involved in cyber security and bring it to my school.</p>
