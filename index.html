<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> Hello and welcome to all my viewers. I am Kayla and I hope you're enjoying this blog I've created from scratch! Now I know, you must be thinking, <i>from scratch?</i> Yep! From scratch! And I wouldn't have achieved this without the Computer Science for Cybersecurity Summer program I'm taking at NYU.</p>

<h3>What About CS4CS?</h3>
<p> What do you usually do over the Summer? If you're someone like me, you love a nice staycation to catch up on some sleep. But, if you're like me again, you're Mom would never let you spend the whole summer in the bed. That's how I got introduced to Computer Science for CyberSecurity, or CS4CS for short. It's a 3- week program meant to expose young women to the computer science and cybersecurity fields of study. By the end of 3- weeks, you may just learned a school year worth of informaton. While it may seem tiring to sit down in a classroom during your Summer off, their activities are engaging and allow students to draw amazing connections between computer science and everyday life. Especially since society is, in some ways, run by technology, this class is relevent and helpful for curious young minds.</p>
