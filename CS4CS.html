<h1>The Tea on CS4CS</h1>
<p>My first day of CS4CS, I was late. Not because I really didn't want to go, even though I really didn't want to gp, but because i couldn't find it! I spent maybe a quarter of an hour walking around in circles, complaining, trying to call my Mom who of course could not pick her up her phone because she was at work. So I was frustrated. Even more, it was a bit intimidating to step into a classroom with complete strangers. However, the moment i saw the girl who would soon take a seat next to me, I knew i would get aling with her. From that time, I knew i had a friend, and I eventually began to open up, and share my personality with the other girls. 
	</p>
	<p>Now, more about the program itself. I heard someone say that it was like spending a whole school day on a single subject. While it can be exciting to learn about computers and keeping mobile devices safe, it can also be a bit draining. I personally function best in interactive learning environments rather than listen to one person rambling in front of a screen that provides the only light in the classroom. Don't get me wrong, I have learned enough to identify phishing attacks when I see one and code this website. But we're always in need of a break. And that's where lunch comes in... </p>
	<p>We get an hour to go outside of the freezing NYU building and explore the community. While it is Brooklyn, and you may not get the best views, it's always lovely to free yourself of the classroom setting and walk around. <i><b>And eat.</b></i> There are many options surrounding the location of the camp, and many seating areas to enjoy a nice lunch conversing with new friends.</p>
	
<h2>No Tears Left to Cry</h2>
<p> In order to allow students to apply the information they learned during the camp, a cumulating Final Challenge is presented. In this Major Challenge, we need to use our new knowledge on cybersecurity and computer science in order to find the missing celeb, Ariana Venti. You may identify  </p>

<h>JOURNAL ENTRY ONE</h>
<h>07/19</h>
<p> We have been invited to crack the case of missing singer, Ariana Venti. According to witnesses, she was found rushing from backstage of her Coachella concert on Sunday, July 8, 2018. The performance was not yet finished when the singer disappeared without a trace. Her assisstant declares that it was due to a family emergency, but Venti has not been seen since. She left a note ciphered using the Vignere Cipher and the key "SLIME". The key was found after forming a cohesive sentence using beads in slime: "The key is in your hands". Using the key and the vignere cipher, we read the note, which was addressed to Beyond-C. Ari informs Beyond-C that she has a message to disclose to her in secret, but that Beyond-C should go on her computer and do "ykw". We determined that "ykw" means "you know what"... but we do not know what.

<h>JOURNAL ENTRY TWO</h>

	<p><b>We have a suspect!</b></p>
	<p>We came across our first <i>real</i> challenge today. We had to break into Ariana Venti's laptop. I originally thought we needed to SQL Inject her laptop to enter her account, but, of course, it didn't work. So we had to guess her password which happened to be "Ariana626". I was annoyed to know that I was overthinking the whole situation. It was only her name and her birthday (without the year) in numeric form.</p>
	<p>Anyways... when we finally got into her computer, the first thing we did was search her files for any information. Ariana's computer only happened to have </p>
