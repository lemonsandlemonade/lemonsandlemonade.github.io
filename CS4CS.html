<h2>No Tears Left to Cry</h2>
<p> In order to allow students to apply the information they learned during the camp, a cumulating Final Challenge is presented. In this Major Challenge, we need to use our new knowledge on cybersecurity and computer science in order to find the missing celeb, Ariana Venti. </p>

<h3>JOURNAL ENTRY ONE</h3>
<h4>07/19</h4>
<p> We have been invited to crack the case of missing singer, Ariana Venti. According to witnesses, she was found rushing from backstage of her Coachella concert on Sunday, July 8, 2018. The performance was not yet finished when the singer disappeared without a trace. Her assisstant declares that it was due to a family emergency, but Venti has not been seen since. She left a note ciphered using the Vignere Cipher and the key "SLIME". The key was found after forming a cohesive sentence using beads in slime: "The key is in your hands". Using the key and the vignere cipher, we read the note, which was addressed to Beyond-C. Ari informs Beyond-C that she has a message to disclose to her in secret, but that Beyond-C should go on her computer and do "ykw". We determined that "ykw" means "you know what"... but we do not know what.
