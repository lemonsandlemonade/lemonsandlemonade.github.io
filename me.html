<h1> She's a Believer and a Coder</h1>
<h2>Dreams and Aspirations</h2>
	<p> From as far back as I can remember, I wanted to become a doctor. <i>Really.</i> From I was in kindergarten I shared my dreams of helping my family any time they needed medical attention. What I didn't notice, however, was how involved I also was in computing. I was fortunate enough to have computers in my house from a young age. I was also fortunate enough to have a mom who knows that sometimes you learn best without any help. That's why if I asked her a question, such as <i> How do I record my voice in Powerpoint?</i>, she would simply tell me to "figure it out" myself. Now when I look back, I realize the importance of fostering the passion for computer science as well as the medical field. </p>
